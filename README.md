## Supports:
* Converting of Chao save files.
* Converting of Main save files.

## How to use:
1. Select the save file you'd like to convert using the button at the bottom right. If selecting a 360/PS3 main save you will be prompted to choose a specific file.
2. Select the version of SA2 you'd like to convert the save to. For Gamecube you'll be prompted to select a region and for main saves you'll also be prompted to choose a save file number. For 360/PS3 you'll be asked if you'd like to add the save to an existing file.
3. Your save will be converted and saved to the location of the original save file you selected unless you're appending the save to a 360/PS3 save in which case it'll be saved to the same folder as the save you requested it be appended to.
